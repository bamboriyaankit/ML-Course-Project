# ML-Course-Project
This repo includes implementation of Variational Autoencoders for MNIST dataset and CIFAR10 dataset.

Detailed Explanation of the project is available at: https://medium.com/@bamboriyaankit/e96bfe859980

Both files contains the code to download the dataset. 

Files can be run directly on GPU or CPU.

The output of VAE on MANIST data set is as follows:

Plot of latent space for all 10 digits is as follows:
